            <h4>Does your environment control you?</h4><br>
            <p>That might be a weird question, but are you letting external factors influence your thoughts, feelings and how you act?<p>

            <br>&nbsp;<h4>The impact of technology on human development</h4><br>

            <p>Technology is part of our lives; worldwide, for example, more than three billion people use the
            Internet. These numbers make us think about the effects that technology has on us.
            But how does our brain cope with such rapid technological development? The answer is simple. It adapts.
            Due to a unique property called plasticity, our brain changes according to its experiences with the
            environment. Our brains have adapted throughout history in order to prepare us to meet the demands we
            face. Proof of this adaptation is the tripling of brain volume from Homohabilis to Homosapiens. In
            addition to changes in structure, there are also changes in brain function. Thus, each time we perform a
            certain task, certain connections between neurons are strengthened, while others are lost.
            Because of the increased accessibility of information through search engines (Google), it is harder for
            us to remember information, but it is much easier for us to remember where we can find it. After all,
            this can also be a testament to the flexibility of the brain. Instead of being overloaded with
            information, he keeps resources to use for other purposes. So, the Internet has become a kind of
            external memory in which we store information. But this may be the explanation for the reversal of the
            Flynn effect (increasing the performance of intelligence tests over generations), given that lately,
            instead of increasing intelligence scores in future generations, there is a downward slope.
            The digital generation has become able to perform several tasks at the same time, but this comes with
            costs in terms of time and performance.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;<h4>How self-driving cars make decisions</h4><br>

            <p>Driverless cars can identify objects, interpret situations, and make decisions based on object detection
            and object classification algorithms. They do this by detecting objects, classifying them, and
            interpreting what they are. Mindy Support provides comprehensive data annotation services to help train
            the machine learning algorithm to make the right decisions when navigating the roads
            Self-driving cars are set to bring one of the biggest changes to our global transportation system in
            decades, but their potential to increase road safety should not be over-emphasized if we want to
            increase peopleâ€™s trust in automated vehicles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In recent years, technology has become an integral part of our lives, significantly facilitating our
            work in many sectors in which we work. Although the jump to online in 2020 was forced, many people were
            already accustomed to the benefits of the Internet and technology in previous years. Many repetitive
            jobs have been replaced by robots and many stores have moved online. Connecting to the Internet has
            become indispensable, and online consumption has increased considerably, from reading news to online
            recording to gambling.
            Flat and thin TVs with a 50-inch diagonal have become indispensable in every apartment, have SMART
            functions and can connect wirelessly to the Internet. They can merge with Netflix and Amazon Prime and
            also respond to voice commands. The visit to the cinema is now easily replaced by a video projector in
            your own apartment or with a very large TV and a bag of popcorn next to it. Food processors are
            increasingly being ordered by young couples, and the latest iPhones are becoming the most common holiday
            or birthday gifts.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;<h4>Easier life through applications</h4><br>

            <p>We have an application for any need, from e-mail, to social networks, music, movies, GPS and even for
            the bank card. We receive notifications by phone about the appointments we have, we approve making
            online payments with an application and we call the taxi just as easily. Online commerce has exploded in
            recent years, with more and more people preferring to save time and often money in this way.
            Shopping at a click away
            The visit to the mall was replaced by a short visit to a clothing or footwear site, the shopping card
            became irreplaceable, and more recently, supermarkets also make home deliveries. Online payments have
            replaced waiting in long queues, so the card has a much higher usage compared to banknotes or any other
            type of cash. Weekly food purchases are selected with a click in a few minutes and delivered to your
            home, thus reducing the time lost with transport, parking, selecting products on the shelf and paying at
            home.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;<h4>The job done remotely</h4><br>

            <p>Meetings at work are mostly online, either on Skype Business or Zoom, and many meetings are replaced by
            a simple phone or video call. Business travel is only possible if it cannot be replaced by a telephone
            or video call. High-performance phones with a quality video camera are now the best way to keep in touch
            with families far away, helping us to feel as close to them as possible and to be able to talk to them
            at any time. The doctor's visits took place online, and the famous public libraries were replaced with
            mobile applications where you can borrow books for a certain period of time, without having to stay in
            the library.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;<h4>Greater accessibility</h4><br>

            <p>Scanning documents has come to be easily replaced by photographing them with a mobile phone, especially
            if most phones have quality cameras. The school is conducted online, professional certifications can
            also be obtained online, and with a suitable chair and desk, even the job can be done from home, without
            having to show up for work in the department. We don't vacuum anymore, we have a robot vacuum cleaner at
            home, which walks around the house alone and collects all the impurities. The traditional toothbrush has
            been replaced with an electric one that we just have to hold in our hand while it rotates its own
            brushes and cleans all impurities from the mouth. Dishwashing is done in fewer and fewer households by
            hand, in the sink, because the automatic dishwasher is already part of the kitchen furniture. Even
            tumble drying is no longer a luxury nowadays, with more and more families opting for an electric tumble
            dryer in their households. We use technology because it makes our lives easier and saves us from
            possible failures such as cooking. A sufficiently efficient Thermomix type food processor is able to
            cook our dinner as our mother would have done as a child and make less trouble in the kitchen.</p>

            <br>&nbsp;<h4>Technology, where to?</h4><br>

            <p>It is true that beyond the visible advantages of technology, people also face a number of disadvantages,
            including the inevitable dependence on it and the cancellation of human interaction. Especially for
            children, technology can be very harmful, because from an early age, they need to socialize to develop
            their communication skills, to express their emotions and to integrate into a team. Isolation and time
            spent away from other children, playing on the tablet, can later have an impact on their behavior, they
            end up preferring the virtual world instead of the real one. Parents will need to fill these social gaps
            with appropriate methods, including seeking the support of a psychologist or spending more time with
            family and friends. It is too late to give up on technology and no one will do it now. We will probably
            have to adapt our lifestyle to the new conditions, and plan our day in a different way.</p>
