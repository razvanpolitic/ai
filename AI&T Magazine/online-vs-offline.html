            <p>They both win. Or no one win. Online versus offline is an outdated approach, because only together can they give concrete results. Didn't I confuse you a little? We immediately put things in order.
                We kept saying how important the online presence is for a company to be known by customers, how much times have changed and how the internet is gaining more and more ground. On the other hand, we did not hesitate to demonstrate to you the importance of graphic and printing services, as a basis for an offline promotion, and without them, likewise, a company cannot exist. After all, in order to be identified and therefore sought after by buyers, which is more important, to be present on the internet or to have a good offline promotion campaign?
                Do you know that moderation is the key? We would paraphrase a bit and say that the key is the mix, one made up of carefully chosen ingredients called online and offline. Undoubtedly, each of the two raw materials mentioned above has its well-defined role in placing a company on the market, but it cannot be said with certainty that only one of them is important.
                For example, in vain you have a good street promotion, if you do not have a well-developed site that can be accessed at any time, as otherwise, in vain you have the best website if you do not appear in the environments where your target audience circulates (magazines, means of public transport, etc.).
                
                But, used together, they can produce amazing results. Because, only in this way you will be able to have the much desired visibility, using with confidence all the exposure media, both online and offline, artificial intelligence/ virtually/ cyberspace and reality.
                Is the future only for AI? Robotics is what makes innovation possible in product design in the world of services, and therefore makes it a “new industry”. And it does so via the integration and hybridization of many other technologies (artificial intelligence, sensory intelligence, the cloud, etc.). It is the engine of the new logistics and intralogistics, of the automated services of cleaning, disinfection or management of waste, of a more precise and safe surgery, of the autonomous vehicles in the future and of so many other widgets that already are improving us our day to day, in the world of the health, of the trade, of the agriculture, of the transport, in the urban surroundings and the public space, in short, everywhere.
                Classic off- and online programming approaches offer different advantages but cannot provide intuitive programming as it would be needed for frequent reconfiguration of industrial robotic cells and their programs. While a simulation and therewith a collision control can be used offline, highest precision can be achieved by using online teach-in.</p>
